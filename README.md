# CustomsBot

This is a bot intended for use on /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS primarily aimed at reducing the number of repetitive tasks hosters are required to carry out.

## Local hosting

First use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary Python packages, add a file called `bot_token` containing your bot token, then run the bot using Python 3+. To use the debugging features with a test bot, add the other bot's token to a file called `test_bot_token`.
